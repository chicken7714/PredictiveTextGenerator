# Predictive Text Generator

In this project, I used C++ to make a predictive text generator. Based on a seed text, this program uses maps, lists, and other data structures to generate a stream of text that is supposed to sound like the seed text.

## How to run:

Use this command to run this program with Plato's "Apology" as the seed text.

 ./main Socrates.txt

## Modifications

You can change how many words are used as the context (more context means more of the original text shows in the output) or the size of the output text. See main.cpp for more details.
